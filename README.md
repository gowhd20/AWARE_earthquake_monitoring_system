# AWARE_earthquake_monitoring_system
# project duration
Sep 2014 ~ Sep 2015

# Features
	- Sensing a fall of a device or could be the user himself/herself
	- Communication between mobile client and backend server via UDP socket
	- Server calculates probability based on the algorithm (see more in our report)
	  and presumes an event of possible earthquake
	- Server broadcasts a warning message to all relevant clients of a detected earthquake
	- Mobile client of which has received warning message from the server provides useful information 
	  such as evaculation protocol or guidance to first aid ...
	  
# Algorithm for detecting an earthquake event 

# Time sync algorithm between server and clients

# Tools
	- Python with plugins
	- Java for android development
	- AWARE framework in which the mobile client was built upon
